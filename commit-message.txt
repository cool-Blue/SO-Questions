orientdb.js
getFamilytreeSingle
- This queries the db for the selected net and returns it: works fine
- Then the sub-net is returned to familytree-d3.js
 - findDuplicatesAndSetEmpty checks if the subnet nodes are already in the main net and, if they are, deletes them from the sub-net
 - then the remaining nodes on the sub-net are concatinated onto the main net.
 - if the main net already contains the selected net the end result is nothing

getFamilytreeAll2
- added this version with the call-back specified by the caller: #seperation of concerns principle

- issues:
 - this module should not make the decision about familytree.getAlreadyThere(): violates Shy principle


familytree-d3.js
- updateGraphByRemoveElement
 - json4Splicing does not do anything, just use currentJason

- initializeGraph
 - moved .attr("xlink:href",  and .on("error", from node to newNode
 - add indexing function to ensure nodes have the same href
  - add imgHref as a seperate function so can use it as index as well as for making the node href

- showAll
 - use getFamilytreeAll2 with callback
 - can eliminate the decision in familytree.js and there, just call familytree.createGraph
